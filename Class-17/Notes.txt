Why JS is single threaded and synchronous ? 

JS is a Single Threaded Synchronous language

Means - Ki ek baar me ek hi task chl ra hoga 

Like -  console.log("first");
        console.log("first");
        console.log("first");

Uppr ke example me pehle first print hoga then second and then third na ki parellel me sare chl rae honge

Example - Google search button doesnt work if a loop is running

---------------------------

console.log("first");
setTimeout(()=>{
        console.log("Timout Executed");
},5000);
console.log("second");

Output -

first
second
Timout Executed //After 5 seconds

----------------------------------------

By the above example we can see that there is someone else that looks the async task that when to complete as JS is synchronous

Web Api - looks for async task and it is multithreaded

        console.log    
        AOM Api 
        fetch
        local storage
        location
        setInterval / setTimeout

JS just runs the synchronous task and send the Async task to web api

Event loop - keep checking it call stack is empty
            checks if call stack is empty
            takes data from callback queue and put in call stack

all fetch calls go to microtask queue and its priority is high than the callback queue 

event loop gives priority to microtask queue
