JS made in 10 days by Brendan Eich in May 1995.

Variables and DataTypes

let var_name = "Name";
console.log(var_name);

Run - node.script.js

let age = 20;
console.log(name, age);

age = 30; // age will become 30 

const account = 1;
account = 2; //Can't change the value for const it is the final value

let and const are latest

We early used the var. So what is the difference between let and var ?

Problems with Var -

var can be declared many times and let can be declared only once.

let - declare value can change value
var - can be declared many times
const - can be declared and initialized only once and value should be initialized while declaration.

One more problem with var -

if(true){
	var a = 20;
}
console.log(a);

Output - 20 // It will print the value even if declared in local scope

Data Types -


Primitive Data Types
Non Primitive Data Types

Primitive - 7 types - immutable data types, pass by value

	number (8 bytes) - 1,2,3,4 (no need to define the type)
	string (8 bytes) - Rohit
	boolean - true or false
	undefined - when no value assigned
	null - we assign that there is no value
	bigint - 2323423423525235n
	symbol -
	const id1 = Symbol("id");

Non Primitive - Mutable data types, pass by refrence

	array
	object
	function

Array -
	let arr = [1,2,3,"name",false];

Object - Foundation hai ye 
	these are key:value pairs

	let obj = {
		name:"name";
		account:12345;
		age:18;
		}

Function -

	let fn = function printName(){
		console.log("name");
	}

Fun fact - in JavaScript we can store a function in a variable


to check the type of any data that you stored use -

console.log(typeof(variable_name)); // console.log(typeof a);

let weather = null;
console.log(typeof weather); // Output: object

It is a bug in JS that type of null shows object

In JS arrays are objects

type of function shows function but it is object
